## What I Learned

* **Email validation**, I learned on how to add email input validation without using JavaScript.

## Built With

This project is created using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Sass**. 

I also used [Mailgo](https://mailgo.dev/), which is a light JavaScript library for `mailto` and `tel`. It will give you a nice popup for every `mailto` and `tel` link.
